jQuery is like a helper for JavaScript that makes it easier to do things on a webpage.

Here's a bit more detail:

JavaScript Simplified: jQuery is a library written in JavaScript. It's designed to simplify common tasks in JavaScript, like handling events (clicking a button, for example), animating elements, making AJAX requests (loading data in the background without refreshing the page), and more.

Easy to Use: With jQuery, you can often accomplish tasks with less code compared to plain JavaScript. It provides a simpler syntax for doing things that might be a bit more complex in raw JavaScript.

Cross-Browser Compatibility: jQuery also helps with cross-browser compatibility. It takes care of some of the differences between web browsers, making your code work more consistently across different browsers.

DOM Manipulation: One of the main things jQuery is used for is manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM). In simpler terms, it helps you change what's on the webpage. For example, you can use it to show or hide elements, add new content, or move things around.

So, if you think of JavaScript as the language that allows you to make your webpage interactive, you can think of jQuery as a friendly assistant that simplifies and streamlines the process of doing common tasks on the web.
